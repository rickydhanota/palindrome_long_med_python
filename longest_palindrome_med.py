# write a function that, given a string, returns its longest palindromic substring.
# a palindrome is defined as a string that's written the same forward and backward. Note that a single-character strings are palindromes. 
# You can assume that there will only be one longest palindromic substring
# Sample input; string = "abaxyzzyxf"
# sample output; "xyzzyx"

def longestPalindromicSubstring(string):
    pass

print(longestPalindromicSubstring("abaxyzzyxf"))
